# Machine Learning Model

## Project Overview

**Objective**:  
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to recommend places destination for itinerary generator. 
Specifically, we aim to predict tourism destination based on inputted category, city, and budget range. This model can be used in Voyageur application or travel recommendation.

**Dataset Description**:  
- **Source**: The dataset is sourced from kaggle and google maps.
- **Features**:  
  - Feature 1: [Description]  
  - Feature 2: [Description]  
  - Feature 3: [Description]  
- **Target Variable**: [Description of the target variable]
- **Size**: [Number of records, rows, or instances in the dataset]
- **Data Type**: [Tabular, Image, Time Series, Text, etc.]
